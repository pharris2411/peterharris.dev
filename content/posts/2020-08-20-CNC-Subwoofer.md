I used it as an opportunity to learn how to 3d model parts and operate a CNC. My friends think I'm crazy, and that my house is going to collapse around me as I watch a movie... we'll see!"

# Background

In 2015 I had a home theater mostly built out from Craigslist finds over the years, but my pride and joy was my Infinity SW-12 subwoofer. Then Interstellar came out on Blu-ray, and I saught to replicate that epic IMAX experience at home. I queued up the rocket launch scene and went for it. The engines roared to life and my body shook as if I was in the cockpit, riding this rocket into the darkness of space with my fellow astronauts. It was truly immersive -- but then a sense I didn't expect kicked in. The acrid smell of burning filled the room, but I didn't have smell-o-vision. The shaking and rumbling stopped despite the rocket still racing through the atmosphere. My invincible Infinity SW-12 had reached its limit and fried itself.

Ugh.

## DIYing The First Subwoofers

I started researching replacements and quickly stumbled [upon the Martysub](https://www.avsforum.com/threads/martysub-faq.1648673/). The more I read, the more I wanted to try my hand at building the subs. I didn't have quite the space necessary for the full Martysub design, so I went with the smaller Micromarty sub design, and then tweaked the plans to have a skinnier + taller cabinet width of 18" and 24" of height. I borrowed some tools from my family members, ordered the new drivers, and got to work.

I spent the next couple weeks cutting out every piece, setting up glue jobs, and finshing the pair of subwoofers. This was my first major woodworking project and despite it being all straight cuts and square joints, it still came out a bit wonky.

I finished one cabinet before really diving into the next one, so I had some time to rethink things. For the next one I went with a window brace since I had some more material left over.

Ultimately after a lot of sanding down they looked alright. I was just going to paint them black anyway.

I fired them up and put them through the same paces as the Infinity SW-12 the Interstellar rocket launch, and they blew me away. It easily reached 102 dB, and I believe this is with just a basic Behringer A500 amplifier giving 175 watts per channel -- I later upgraded to a Crown XLS2500 which is rated for 775 watts per channel!

## New House, New Theater

Towards the end of 2015 we received a letter adressed to the occupants of the home notifying us that the house was under foreclosure. Our landlord hadn't been paying the mortgage. I'd been there for 3 years and I still wonder to this day what he did with my rent money. I set out to purchase a house for myself, and one of the key factors was a detached single family home with a good sized basement to start building out my dream theater.

> A nice blank slate.

It took another few years to finally come to fruition, definitely longer than I expected, but it was absolutely worth it in the end. Many months of planning went into the theater, and many more to actually build it. I remember when HBO announced Game of Thrones Season 7 start date is when I really kicked into high gear with working on the theater to try and finish it in time. August 19th, 2017 I moved the couches into the room, and 20th had people over for a GoT viewing party. It sounded amazing and it was so incredible to be *done*. But this was only the beginning.

> Hey look, Interstellar again! V1 of the theater re-used a cheap 92" screen from SilverTicket.

Eventually I stepped up to a 120" acoustically transparent Center Stage XD screen from Seymour AV, and was able to place the DIYSoundGroup HTM-12's behind the screen. The subwoofers still hung out in front though.

Things were good. The theater was by far the best system I had ever put together, and the pair of subwoofers kicked hard. But... not as hard as I would have expected. The DIYSoundGroup speakers I picked for the main speakers and surround speakers had no practical limits, they could play cleanly to absolutely deafening levels. I tried a few times with various movies with hearing protection and it was incredible, but the subs couldn't quite keep up. It was loud, sure, but the pair of subs would hit their limits within listening volumes... and that just wasn't enough. Plus they were just... there. The point of going with an acoustically transparent screen was to have a totally clean view up front, just you and the movie. Right now it was you, the movie, and those two massive boxes up front.

As luck would have it, in September 2018 the basement flooded. I managed to stay on top of the water as it came in (staying up from 1:30 AM through 5 AM one night with a shop-vac...) so no equipment was damaged, but the walls were shot. It was a bit of a blessing in disguise though as I ended up redoing the front false wall to make space for the subwoofers, and it just so worked out that I could fit another two subwoofers up front too. I finished rebuilding around March 2019.

# Designing the New Subwoofers

Alright, so I knew I wanted two more subwoofers, but I also didn't want to make these again by hand the same way I had before. While building the theater I had purchased a few flat-packs from DIYSoundGroup for the HTM-12 and Volt-10's, and was amazed at the precision and how they came together so effortlessly.

> The HTM-12 enclosure dry fitting together. The dado grooves cut into the enclosure meant every piece just snapped right in which made gluing up the cabinet so much easier.

I wanted to replicate the same precision with my next build, and a friend of mine had access to a CNC through work. He offered to help out if I could create the models and tool paths necessary and suggested using Fusion 360. I fired it up and dusted off my CAD skills I hadn't touched in 10 years, then stumbled through creating a model from scratch.

Ultimately the design is still fundamentally the same as the subwoofers I built a few years prior, the external dimensions and port tuning are all identical. But the inside is where things differ the most, and it now features a super strong internal bracing structure.
